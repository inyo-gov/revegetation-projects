# Revegetation Monitoring Report

# Land Removed from Irrigation: Laws Parcels 090, 095,129, and Abandoned Land Parcel 094

## Objective

Determine if monitoring data meet specified quantitative cover and composition goals outlined in the 2003 plan.

## Background

In November 2022, the Inyo County Water Department (ICWD) received LADWP's 2022 report on respective parcels in July 2022. The report claimed that the revegetation goals had been met. The transects in Laws 90, 94, and 95 were measured again in 2024.
