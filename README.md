# Evaluation of LADWP's Revegetation Monitoring Report for Land Removed from Irrigation: Laws Parcels 090, 095,129, and Abandoned Land Parcel 094

## Overview

This project involves the evaluation of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power's (LADWP) "Revegetation Monitoring Report for Land Removed from Irrigation" for Laws Parcels 090, 095, 129, and Abandoned Land Parcel 094. The goal is to determine if the revegetation efforts meet the specified goals outlined in the 2003 plan.

## Background

In November 2022, the Inyo County Water Department (ICWD) received LADWP's 2022 report, which measured transects in the specified parcels in July 2022. The report claims that the revegetation goals have been met, starting a two-year period to test the persistence of vegetation without irrigation. This project aims to independently evaluate the data against the 2003 plan goals.

## Tasks

1.  **Evaluate Data**: Analyze the data collected in July 2022 against the 2003 plan's cover and composition goals.
2.  **Visualize Data**: Create plots of transect-level composition and species spatial distribution.

The analysis website is deployed at <https://inyo-gov.github.io/revegetation-projects/>

## Initial Recommendations

1)  Resurvey in 2025 with a jointly developed survey methodology, following two full growing seasons (2023, 2024) without irrigation.
2)  Then resurvey in 2028 again for concern of rabbitbrush persistence.
3)  Should the parcel fall below the cover goal during subsequent monitoring, more appropriate species should be planted.
4)  Revegetate the remaining bare areas of the parcels such as service roads.
5)  Work on a jointly developed monitoring plan to assess goal attainment.
