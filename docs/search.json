Data Ingestion\n\nLAW90/94/95 parcels: Processed from individual CSV files\nLAW118/129 parcels: Processed from Excel files\nTransect normalization: All transect labels converted to lowercase (e.g., “3A” → “3a”)\n\n\n\n2. Cover Calculation\n\nPer-transect basis: Cover calculated for each transect individually\nSpecies aggregation: Multiple hits per species per transect are summed\nPercent cover: Reference parcel hits directly represent percent cover\n\n\n\n3. Complete Data Accounting\n\nComplete dataset: All parcel-year-transect-species combinations included\nZero-filling: Missing species receive 0% cover (not excluded from averages)\nGroup averages: Policy caps calculated from ALL parcels in reference groups, including those with zero ATTO/ERNA cover\n\n\n\n4. Policy Cap Calculation\n\nThree-step process:\n\nSum hits per species per transect (transect scale)\nAverage cover per transect within each parcel (parcel scale)\nAverage across all parcels in reference group (group scale)\n\nConservative approach: Includes parcels with zero ATTO/ERNA to provide realistic baseline\nGroup-specific caps: Separate thresholds for LAW90/94/95 vs. LAW118/129 reference groups\n\nThis methodology ensures that policy caps reflect the true range of conditions across reference parcels."

    "text": "Policy-Based Capping Parameters\nThe capping system uses fixed policy-based parameters rather than reference data averages:\n\nLAW90/94/95 Group:\n\nATTO: 0.3% maximum allowable cover\nERNA10: 0.3% maximum allowable cover\nATPO: Not applicable (no cap set)\n\n\n\nLAW118/129 Group:\n\nATTO: 2.0% maximum allowable cover\nERNA10: 2.0% maximum allowable cover\nATPO: 3.0% maximum allowable cover (when present)\n\n\n\nHow Capping Works:\nThe capping mechanism limits species cover to policy-based caps. For example: - If a transect has 10% ERNA cover but the cap is 2%, only 2% is added to the original perennial cover (excluding ATTO/ERNA/ATPO) - For LAW118/129 parcels, if ATPO is present, it is capped at maximum 3% regardless of actual cover - Only actual cover present is added - no theoretical maximums are applied\nThis approach ensures conservative compliance assessment by only including cover for species that are actually present, while applying appropriate policy-based limits."
