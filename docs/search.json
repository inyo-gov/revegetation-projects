    "text": "In November 2022, Inyo County Water Department (ICWD) received Los Angeles Department of Water and Power’s (LADWP) report entitled “Revegetation Monitoring Report for Land Removed from Irrigation: Laws Parcels 090, 095,129, and Abandoned Land Parcel 094” (hereafter 2022 report).\nAs part of the “Irrigation Project in the Laws Area” negative declaration of environmental impact (hereafter Laws MND), a plan to revegetate lands removed from irrigation was outlined in attachment 4 of the Laws MND titled. “Revegetation Plans for Lands Removed from Irrigation Laws Parcels 90, 95, and 129 And Abandoned Agricultural Land Parcel 94” (hereafter 2003 Plan). This 2003 plan explains:\n\nThere are three parcels in the Laws Ranch lease that were previously irrigated and will not be irrigated in the future under the plan for re-irrigation of the ranch.\n\n\nThese parcels are Laws 90, 95 and 129. A portion of Laws 118 surrounds parcel 129. This area will be fenced and revegetation will be augmented, as needed, in conjunction with parcel 129. Laws parcel 94, which was mapped as abandoned agricultural land, will also be revegetated.\n\n\nUnder these plans, the parcels will be revegetated with the goal of restoring native vegetation that is similar in cover, and species composition to nearby sites. The prescribed conditions are to be established on each parcel by 2013, and must be present two years after established with no on-site revegetation activities.–2003 Plan\n\nThe 2022 report explains that LADWP and consultants measured transects in Laws 90, 94, 95, and 129 in July of 2022; and analysis of those data allowed determining the 2003 revegetation goals have been met as of the last half of July 20221. Irrigation was not supplied after June 2022; and because vegetation goals were met in July, the two-year period to test whether the established shrubs can persist without summer drip irrigation official began July 2022 - triggering re-measurement in July 2024 - at which point the 2024 data will determine whether goals have been sustained for two years or 730 days since first measurements2. At this point, LADWP will consider the project complete:\n\n“If a parcel meets the goals after the two year rest, no further revegetation activities will be necessary and the parcel will be considered complete”. – LADWP 2022\n\nData supporting the report collected by LADWP in summer 2022 was received by ICWD staff in a digital excel file January 27th 2023."
