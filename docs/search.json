    "text": "Data Processing Methodology\nThe reference parcel analysis follows a systematic approach to ensure accurate and consistent policy cap calculations:\n\n1. Data Ingestion\n\nLAW90/94/95 parcels: Processed from individual CSV files\nLAW118/129 parcels: Processed from Excel files\nTransect normalization: All transect labels converted to lowercase (e.g., “3A” → “3a”)\n\n\n\n2. Cover Calculation\n\nPer-transect basis: Cover calculated for each transect individually\nSpecies aggregation: Multiple hits per species per transect are summed\nPercent cover: Reference parcel hits directly represent percent cover\n\n\n\n3. Complete Data Accounting\n\nComplete dataset: All parcel-year-transect-species combinations included\nZero-filling: Missing species receive 0% cover (not excluded from averages)\nGroup averages: Policy caps calculated from ALL parcels in reference groups, including those with zero ATTO/ERNA cover\n\n\n\n4. Policy Cap Calculation\n\nTwo-step averaging:\n\nAverage cover per transect within each parcel\nAverage across all parcels in reference group\n\nConservative approach: Includes parcels with zero ATTO/ERNA to provide realistic baseline\nGroup-specific caps: Separate thresholds for LAW90/94/95 vs. LAW118/129 reference groups\n\nThis methodology ensures that policy caps reflect the true range of conditions across reference parcels."
