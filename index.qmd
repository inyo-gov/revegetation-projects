# Background

In November 2022, Inyo County Water Department (ICWD) received Los Angeles Department of Water and Power's (LADWP) report entitled "*Revegetation Monitoring Report for Land Removed from Irrigation: Laws Parcels 090, 095,129, and Abandoned Land Parcel 094*" (hereafter 2022 report).

As part of the ["Irrigation Project in the Laws Area" negative declaration of environmental impact (hereafter Laws MND)](https://www.inyowater.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Laws_Neg_Dec_3-17-03.pdf), a plan to revegetate lands removed from irrigation was outlined in attachment 4 of the Laws MND titled. ["Revegetation Plans for Lands Removed from Irrigation Laws Parcels 90, 95, and 129 And Abandoned Agricultural Land Parcel 94" (hereafter 2003 Plan)](https://www.inyowater.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Laws-Neg-Dec-Reveg-plan-FINAL-3-17-03-copy.pdf). This 2003 plan explains:

> There are three parcels in the Laws Ranch lease that were previously irrigated and will not be irrigated in the future under the plan for re-irrigation of the ranch.

> These parcels are Laws 90, 95 and 129. A portion of Laws 118 surrounds parcel 129. This area will be fenced and revegetation will be augmented, as needed, in conjunction with parcel 129. Laws parcel 94, which was mapped as abandoned agricultural land, will also be revegetated.

> Under these plans, the parcels will be revegetated with the goal of restoring native vegetation that is similar in cover, and species composition to nearby sites. The prescribed conditions are to be established on each parcel by 2013, and must be present two years after established with no on-site revegetation activities.--2003 Plan

The 2022 report explains that LADWP and consultants measured transects in Laws 90, 94, 95, and 129 in July of 2022; and analysis of those data allowed determining the 2003 revegetation goals have been met as of the last half of July 2022[^1]. Irrigation was not supplied after June 2022; and because vegetation goals were met in July, the two-year period to test whether the established shrubs can persist without summer drip irrigation official began July 2022 - triggering re-measurement in July 2024 - at which point the 2024 data will determine whether goals have been sustained for two years or `r 365*2` days since first measurements[^2]. At this point, LADWP will consider the project complete:

[^1]: LADWP indicated that no irrigation occurred after approximately June 2022 owing to the summer rains in 2022 augmenting soil moisture

[^2]: The timing of this materializes as a test of the full 2023 growing season without irrigation and most of 2024 through July, but not August 2024 - which would be the second full complete growing season.

> "If a parcel meets the goals after the two year rest, no further revegetation activities will be necessary and the parcel will be considered complete". -- LADWP 2022

Data supporting the report collected by LADWP in summer 2022 was received by ICWD staff in a digital excel file January 27th 2023.

# Tasks

The purpose of this report (hereafter 2023 data summary) is to:

1.  Evaluate the data provided to ICWD (collected in July 2022 by LADWP staff and consultants) against the various cover and composition goals of the 2003 plan[^3]. Specifically, compute average perennial cover at the transect and parcel scale, enumerate the number of species detected on the transects and parcel in total, determine whether or not 5-6 of those species were detected at the 0.05-0.075% cover level for the parcel (2-3 out of 4,000 possible hits), and whether or not each transect minimally had 2% cover (1 hit out of 200 possible).

[^3]: This report is intended to provide technical analysis within the narrow scope of the 2022 data and the specific 2003 plan success metrics.

<!-- -->

2.  Plot transect-level composition and species spatial distribution. Specifically, for each parcel, with discrete transect identity on the x-axis, stack perennial species cover in bar plots for all transects on the y-axis. Color the stacked species blocks by species code. Second, for each parcel, facet by species so each species has it's own plot and map the transect locations and size the points proportional to the species-level transect % cover.

```{r}
# The xy coordinates of the transects provided were joined to the field data consisting of parcel-transect-species-count row combinations allowing the spatial distribution of the plant species across the transect network to be plotted.
# Transects were 50 m long and sampled every 25 cm yielding 200 possible hits in the denominator where fractional cover is hits/200 from 0-1 and multiplying by 100 yields cover values on the 0-100 scale.
# Cover for each species on the 0-100 scale is computed for each transect. These values are averaged over all 20 transects to yield the parcel average which is the key performance indicator in that it is the hardest to meet. the composition goal doesn't make specific composition targets but rather is written to make sure at least .5% cover of six species occurs on xx transects



# grab the crs from another shapefile in NAD83 z11 to apply to the xy coordinates.

# 2022 Data and 2003 revegetation goals

After examining the data provided to ICWD against the 2003 MND Revegetation Plan revegetation goals, LADWP's reporting comports with ICWD's independent data summaries in that cover goals and species richness was satisfied based on LADWP's 2022 data collection. See @tbl-summary for an overview of cover values for all parcels. Species level tables for each parcel, species composition charts for each transect and spatial maps of species transect cover are located in the following sections: Laws 90 (@tbl-law090-transect-species, @fig-stacked-composition-law090, @fig-law090-transect-species-map), Laws 95 (@tbl-law095-transect-species, @fig-stacked-composition-law095, @fig-law095-transect-species-map), Laws 94 (@tbl-law094-transect-species, @fig-stacked-composition-law094, @fig-law094-transect-species-map), and Laws 129 (@tbl-law129-transect-species, @fig-stacked-composition-law129, @fig-law118_129-transect-species-map ).

In reference to the 2003 plan:

> In preparing this plan, vegetation cover, composition, and species lists were determined by reviewing the LADWP 1984-87 vegetation inventory data for parcels in the vicinity (Appendix II) and located in the same ecological (range) site class in the Draft Benton-Owens Valley Soil Survey, hereafter referred to as the NRCS (Natural Resources Conservation Service 1994). -- 2003 Plan

> In addition, species lists and other information from the NRCS descriptions were incorporated (Appendix I). --2003 Plan
